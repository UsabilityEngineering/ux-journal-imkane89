# Voice Commands with Alexa
Date: 11/22/24


I interacted with my smart home assistant, my goal was to have it dim the lights, Play some music, and set an alarm for the next morning, all through voice command. However, this interaction highlighted the pros and cons of only using voice-based interactions.

## The Interaction
I first started by having Alexa dim the lights, "Alexa dim the lights by 50%.", the home assistant responded by dimming the lights. Next, I asked it to play Relaxing instrumental music on Spotify, however, it responded with something like "I can't find relaxing instrumental music on Spotify". I rephrased my request multiple times before it started playing relaxing instrumental music. I then asked it to set an alarm for 7am the next day, "Alexa set an alarm for 7am tomorrow morning", and responded by saying it successfully set the alarm.

##Assessing the User Experience

Alexa was **effective** (the accuracy and completeness of achieving user goals) in handling simple commands such as dimming the lights or setting alarms. However, it has difficulty understanding music requests. Alexas did great in giving **feedback** (the ability to communicate the result of an action to the user) for successful tasks like dimming the lights or setting alarms. however when it came to requests it couldn't complete the **feedback** and lacked information on ways to reiterate my command for them to better understand. ho
